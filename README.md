# Dynamic Bitset

A simple implementation of a dynamic bitset in C++.
This implementation forbids the allocation of non-significant zeros on the left.

This is used to explore performance optimizations, vector\<bool\> intricacies, good code practices, C++ devops integration, SIMD vectorization operations, etc.
